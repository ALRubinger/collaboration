# Getting Started with the Web5 Decentralized Web Platform

The Web5 Decentralized Web Platform provides the base for building decentralized applications. The principal component for this project is `dwn-sdk-js`, a JavaScript implementation of the [Decentralized Web Node Specification](https://identity.foundation/decentralized-web-node/spec/). The platform also contains identity services and primitives noted in the [Getting Started with SSI documentation](./GETTING_STARTED_SSI.md)
