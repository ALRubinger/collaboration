# TBD Collaboration Repository

This repository is the welcoming point to TBD's open source efforts. It outlines the tbDEX and 
Identity systems being built and the components which comprise them. It's your first stop to getting 
involved.

## Overview

TBD [#11](https://github.com/TBD54566975/collaboration/issues/11).

Template:

Orient users to the project here. This is a good place to start with an assumption
that the user knows very little - so start with the Big Picture and show how this
project fits into it. It may be good to reference/link the broader architecture in the
`collaboration` repo or the developer site here.

Then maybe a dive into what this project does.

Diagrams and other visuals are helpful here. Perhaps code snippets showing usage.

## Current Work

Our work is prioritized around team and project goals for the [current milestone](./CURRENT.md).
