# Week of 21 February 2023

# Team

## Weekly Retro and Action Items

- Keep:
  - Working in public! Pulled in Frank, Kirah, Tania. And we're spearheading ways to collaborate in public as opposed to the internal systems we're used to, like Notion.
  - Well-defined structure and expectations for public meetings.
  - Discipline around that structure. For instance, in syncs: identify issues, ensure the people who need to connect are aware, then let them solve together in public outside of the sync
  - Using Discord's "Stage" feature for meetings with agendas, Voice Channels for more open forums like office hours
  - Public Comms:
    - Project Boards for issue tracking
    - Markdown or text files for larger collaborative working (for instance, site map and site copy, or proposals). Issued as PRs so people can comment line by line and we evolve the branch on upstream together.
- Ditch
  - We put more structure around meetings because we found that open forums were too undirected to be beneficial to folks.
