# Week of 30 January 2023

## Weekly Retro and Action Items

* At end of every week, ALR (or team) to take the retro items and make issues out of them, else they just sit there and nothing happens (as observed from last week's retro items, untouched).
* Make first and last day of the week calls longer to accommodate scoping and retro
