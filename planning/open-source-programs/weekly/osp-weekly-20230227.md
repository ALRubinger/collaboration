# Week of 27 February 2023

# Team

## Weekly Retro and Action Items

- Tasks "in review" tend to take longer than we estimate - it's async, it's iterative, and it may uncover things we haven't thought about
- Declare at top of the week: availability. Interviews, travel, etc take away from available timer and it's not always 5 business days
- ALR, if looking for DRIs to break down tasks, pair with them on it to walk through the components and scope out the work

# ALR
