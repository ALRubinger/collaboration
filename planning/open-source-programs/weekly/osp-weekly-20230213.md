## Weekly Retro and Action Items

- Working model that we should keep and encourage:
  - Rubber ducking
  - Asking questions about sticky and frustrating points in the work
  - Offering support, outside perspectives, and divergent thoughts to the DRI so they can make incorporate those into their decision-making process
  - _Example_: Nick working through the Tech Debt payoff
- Move long Proposals to PRs instead of Issues
  - `[PROPOSAL]`s in GitHub Issues are not great when they're long, because the only way comment on them and edit them is at the bottom of the page. Instead, let's try surfacing longer longer proposals as files in the repo, submitted into an upstream branch as a PR. Then, everyone incl community can comment on the PR line by line as if it were a code review, and we get threaded conversations with context.   
  - _Example_: the long PROPOSAL in [Developer Documentation Phase 2](https://github.com/TBD54566975/developer.tbd.website/issues/327) which is really hard to reply to as a GitHub Issue. We shouldn't have to copy into a Google Doc, but we *do* want the Google Doc experience, in public.
- Move from `#tbdiscussions` to `#tbd-stage`
  - Structured meetings have agendas, and we want to be holding those in public for the community to take part. But we also don't want agendas getting sidelined by folks dropping in and just starting to talk. :) So the Stage lets the hosts grant access to speak, and it's still open to everyone.

## Focus for the Week

*What are you working towards in filling the Cycle? May be a burndown list of what you hope to achieve this week, and is likely the most important part of the Standup Process.*

- Clearly outline focus:
  - Getting folks building Web5 applications
  - Programs work readiness which encourages this
  - Working through definition of that focus w/ all open source teams
  - Communicating that focus means choosing what not to do
- Outling [Getting Started Experience](https://github.com/TBD54566975/collaboration/issues/48) and break it down w/ all teams
- Support Nick through:
  -  [developer.tbd.website Tech Debt Payoff](https://github.com/TBD54566975/developer.tbd.website/issues/325)
  -  Scoping Documentation Phase 2 w/ team
  -  [Revamp of developer.tbd.website](https://github.com/TBD54566975/developer.tbd.website/issues/326) w/ team
- Port all Retro items from last 2 weeks into issue tracking

## Close of Week Summary
 - Got cross team alignment on the importance of Getting Started 
 - Scheduled a F2F to address specifically Getting Started for the first week of April
 - Seeded the [Developer Documentation Phase 2](https://github.com/TBD54566975/developer.tbd.website/issues/327) project with team
 - TODO: Align on the above; not quite there yet, but it'll be the Big Focus of next week
 - [Getting Started Experience](https://github.com/TBD54566975/collaboration/issues/48) - need to work on Monday in free time to catch up. Scoping Docs Infra Phase 2 took much more time this week than expected, but it was a good investment.
 - [Revamp of developer.tbd.website](https://github.com/TBD54566975/developer.tbd.website/issues/326) - didn't touch it this week. Keeping focus on Docs Infra and Getting Started experience and there was no room for it.
 - Port all Retro items from last 2 weeks into issue tracking (did not do)
