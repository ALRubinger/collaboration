# Week of 06 March 2023

# Team

## Weekly Retro and Action Items

- Keep and expand: identifying urgent priorities and adjusting the goals and planning while in-flight to accommodate. Example: a docs framework may accelerate our timeline to the quality we want of docs, so we put it on the board as an important item to dissect and work through as a stretch goal for Phase 2
- To improve: all team should develop routine and discipline around reflecting all work in tickets, and updating those tickets with comments as work progresses. This will advance our asychrony and help us to drop things like meetings and calls
