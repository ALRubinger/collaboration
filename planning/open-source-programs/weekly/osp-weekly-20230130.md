## Weekly Retro and Action Items

- Return to this document throughout our daily standups - keeps track of the stated commitments so we’re reminded of them
- Introduce Issue Grooming not ad-hoc as we’ve been doing, but scheduled.
    - Async could even work for this - as a repetitive IC task
    - And Linear and GitHub
- Institute redirect policy for developer.tbd.website
    - Whenever we push a change to the Developer Site that makes for a relocation or removal of a URL, create a redirect or other page that is more appropriate than a 404 for people expecting the previously-linked content
    - Publish awareness to rest of the team incl Partnerships, OSE, DevRel a table of the URLs that are about to move or be removed for their input as to what’s relying on it
    - Write this up and put into the `CONTRIBUTING` of developer.tbd.website.
- New policy for developer.tbd.website: name branches after the issue number (ie `issue-XXX` that describes them. This will provide all content needed for anyone to know what this branch is about.
    - And the creator of that branch is responsible for rebasing it off `main` regularly
    - Put this in `CONTRIBUTING`, too
