# 2 Weeks of 13 March 2023

# Team

## Weekly Retro and Action Items

- Increase our discipline around requirements gathering. Assess implementation proposals around principles: what they give us, drawbacks, relative priority of each.
- Moar Discord. ALR observing lots of convos and decision points still made in private (including his own!). Moving these into a thread on Discord invites the rest of the team and community to follow along, offer lifting or alternative perspectives, and feel greater ownership. Also keeps us better in sync which may allow us to remove Standup sync meetings. This based on observation of how much work's been done the past 2+ weeks, and casual scroll of #community seeing that lots of this was done outside of GH issue discussions and public channels.
- When Paris warns Nick to not eat something: don't eat that thing.
- When ALR agrees to a 9am meeting while on PTO in Vegas: don't.

## Focus for the Week

*What are you working towards in filling the Cycle? May be a burndown list of what you hope to achieve this week, and is likely the most important part of the Standup Process.*

  - Initial tech assessment of GitBook to start
  - Some impl barriers to a simple lift 'n shift to GitBook as it's a hosted offering - Nick is digging more. If we end up selecting this, may involve a discussion about tradeoffs to make a decision.

- Web5 Platform readiness and how that informs docs work (Ongoing through Austin, seeing good OSE alignment as we go)
