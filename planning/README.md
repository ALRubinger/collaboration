# Work Scoping

## Open Source Programs

The TBD Open Source Programs team scopes its work weekly. 
This is to identify longer-running priorities and ensure 
our day-to-day work reflects what's important - not just 
what's urgent over the course of a day.

Over the course of the week, scoping is done 
in a [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) Markdown document for easier 
multiuser real-time editing. Once
collaborative editing is done, its committed to Git.
