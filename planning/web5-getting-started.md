# Web5 Getting Started Experience

Our primary ambition for TBD and Web5â€™s success is in *building ecosystem*. Advancing decentralization and identity on the web, and international finance stemming from unlocking that, isnâ€™t believable as a closed product. Web5 is an open platform for anyone to build value for themselves. In Austin we come together to bootstrap Web5 Application Builders - from open source engineeringâ€™s software to Developer Relationsâ€™ content and documentation, and Open Source Programâ€™s systems and processes.
