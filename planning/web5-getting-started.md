# Web5 Getting Started Experience

Our primary ambition for TBD and Web5â€™s success is in *building ecosystem*. Advancing decentralization and identity on the web, and international finance stemming from unlocking that, isnâ€™t believable as a closed product. Web5 is an open platform for anyone to build value for themselves. This converged workstream delivers for application developers and contributors - from open source engineeringâ€™s software to Developer Relationsâ€™ content and documentation, and Open Source Programâ€™s systems and processes.

## Phase 4

This is a *DRAFT* until socialized and this message is removed.

### Collaboration
* [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/TBD54566975/projects/10/views/9)
* [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/937858703112155166/949067751803191397)

### Goals
* Mirror the BTC Miami Messaging and Deliverables for a Global Audience
  * All delivered on developer.tbd.website, with docs and guides for the software we're highlighting
  * Primary call to action: Build Web5 Applications using DWNs through the Dev Site
  * Secondary call to action: Join the Discord community
* Developer Story
  * The Web5 Platform makes decentralized application development easy and secure
    * Like HTML5, Web5 enhances the web. It adds: privacy, decentralization, and identity.
    * No need to create your own ad-hoc decentralized network
    * No need to handle the messy networking to transmit and receive data
    * Is web-native and can run in any browser
  * Web5's Personal Data Stores (via the DWN standard) allow developers to create applications where users own their data
    * ...so app developers don't need to
    * ...so app customers retain their privacy 
    * ...and can selectively share that data with others
  * DWAs (Decentralized Web Applications) are a simple programming model, mirroring [PWAs](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) (Progressive Web Applications) which can be installed directly from the web
* Priority Deliverables
  * [New Web5 Version](https://github.com/orgs/TBD54566975/projects/10/views/9?pane=issue&itemId=27187488)
  * [Doc Upgrades for new Web5 Version](https://github.com/orgs/TBD54566975/projects/10/views/9?pane=issue&itemId=27189248) 
  * [Revamped API Docs for Web5](https://github.com/orgs/TBD54566975/projects/10/views/9?pane=issue&itemId=27190351)
  * [Create Guide: Start your own DWN Server](https://github.com/TBD54566975/developer.tbd.website/issues/437)
  * [Create Guide: DWAs and Starter App](https://github.com/TBD54566975/developer.tbd.website/issues/438)
  * [Timeboxed Design pass on Docs Section](https://github.com/TBD54566975/developer.tbd.website/issues/439)
  * Tutorial around Music Player (stretch)
    * Needs definition from Daniel
  * CTAs
    * SWAG awards, Recognition - for what actions?
